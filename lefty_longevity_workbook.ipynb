    "Barack Obama is left-handed. So are Bill Gates and Oprah Winfrey; so were Babe Ruth and Marie Curie. A [1991 study](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199104043241418) reported that left-handed people die on average nine years earlier than right-handed people. Nine years! Could this really be true? \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore this phenomenon using age distribution data to see if we can reproduce a difference in average age at death purely from the changing rates of left-handedness over time, refuting the claim of early death for left-handers. This notebook uses `pandas` and Bayesian statistics to analyze the probability of being a certain age at death given that you are reported as left-handed or right-handed.\n",
    "\n",
    "A National Geographic survey in 1986 resulted in over a million responses that included age, sex, and hand preference for throwing and writing. Researchers Avery Gilbert and Charles Wysocki analyzed this data and noticed that rates of left-handedness were around 13% for people younger than 40 but decreased with age to about 5% by the age of 80. They concluded based on analysis of a subgroup of people who throw left-handed but write right-handed that this age-dependence was primarily due to changing social acceptability of left-handedness. This means that the rates aren't a factor of *age* specifically but rather of the *year you were born*, and if the same study was done today, we should expect a shifted version of the same distribution as a function of age. Ultimately, we'll see what effect this changing rate has on the apparent mean age of death of left-handed people, but let's start by plotting the rates of left-handedness as a function of age.\n",

    "This notebook uses two datasets: [death distribution data](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/statab/vs00199_table310.pdf) for the United States from the year 1999 (source website [here](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/mortality_tables.htm)) and rates of left-handedness digitized from a figure in this [1992 paper by Gilbert and Wysocki](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1528408).

    "We got a pretty big age gap between left-handed and right-handed people purely as a result of the changing rates of left-handedness in the population, which is good news for left-handers: you probably won't die young because of your sinisterness. The reported rates of left-handedness have increased from just 3% in the early 1900s to about 11% today, which means that older people are much more likely to be reported as right-handed than left-handed, and so looking at a sample of recently deceased people will have more old right-handers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our number is still less than the 9-year gap measured in the study. It's possible that some of the approximations we made are the cause: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. We used death distribution data from almost ten years after the study (1999 instead of 1991), and we used death data from the entire United States instead of California alone (which was the original study). \n",
    "2. We extrapolated the left-handedness survey results to older and younger age groups, but it's possible our extrapolation wasn't close enough to the true rates for those ages. \n",
    "\n",
    "One thing we could do next is figure out how much variability we would expect to encounter in the age difference purely because of random sampling: if you take a smaller sample of recently deceased people and assign handedness with the probabilities of the survey, what does that distribution look like? How often would we encounter an age gap of nine years using the same data and assumptions? We won't do that here, but it's possible with this data and the tools of random sampling. \n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- I did do this if we want to add more tasks - it would probably take three more blocks.-->\n",
    "\n",
    "To finish off, let's calculate the age gap we'd expect if we did the study in 2018 instead of in 1990. The gap turns out to be much smaller since rates of left-handedness haven't increased for people born after about 1960. Both the National Geographic study and the 1990 study happened at a unique time - the rates of left-handedness had been changing across the lifetimes of most people alive, and the difference in handedness between old and young was at its most striking.
